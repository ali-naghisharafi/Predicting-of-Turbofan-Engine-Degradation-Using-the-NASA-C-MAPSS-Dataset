# Predicting-of-Turbofan-Engine-Degradation-Using-the-NASA-C-MAPSS-Dataset
This repository contains the implementation of a method to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of turbofan engines based on the NASA C-MAPSS dataset. The approach is based on the reference paper by Shcherbakov et al., 2022, and includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.
